# BUS-446-Project
Final Project
This report analyzes how producer price inflation (PPI) translates into consumer price inflation (CPI) across major food categories, using both Excel charts for historical context and Tableau dashboards for forecast dynamics. The combined visuals highlight where pass‑through is strongest, where volatility is concentrated—particularly in beef and eggs—and how retail smoothing moderates extreme producer swings. Together, the findings provide a clear framework for anticipating inflationary pressures and understanding their impact on household budgets.
