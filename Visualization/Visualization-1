Goal: Compare expected Producer Price Index (PPI) to expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) across food categories. (Top is CPI, and bottom is PPI) 
Chart 1 shows that producer price inflation (PPI) does not affect all food categories equally. Meats, dairy, and fats & oils show strong pass-through from producer to consumer prices, while fresh produce categories show weaker alignment, suggesting greater volatility and outside factors.
